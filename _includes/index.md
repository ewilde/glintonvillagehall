<p style="text-align: center">WELCOME TO GLINTON VILLAGE HALL</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A GREAT VENUE IN A GREAT LOCATION</p>

Glinton Village Hall is the ideal venue for private parties, meetings, fund raising events, rehearsal space and various classes.  It is very well used by everyone from pre-school children to senior citizens and is managed by the Glinton Community Association<br /> 

There are 2 halls: the [**main hall**](/photos/MainHall.jpg) and the [**small hall**](/photos/SmallHall.jpg). They are divided by an acoustic wall which enables the halls to be used separately or, by folding back the wall, both halls can be used together.<br />
